What are Events?
All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

An event represents the precise moment when something happens.

Examples:

moving a mouse over an element
selecting a radio button
clicking on an element
The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".

Here are some common DOM events:
Mouse Events	Keyboard Events	Form Events	Document/Window Events
click		keypress	submit		load
dblclick	keydown		change		resize
mouseenter	keyup		focus		scroll
mouseleave	 		blur		unload

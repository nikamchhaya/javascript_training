var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/users/anuradha9712');
request.send();
request.onload = ()=>{
    console.log(JSON.parse(request.response));
}
?? Fetch
The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network) in an asynchronous manner.
It returns a Promise
It is an object which contains a single value either a Response or an Error that occurred.
.then() tells the program what to do once Promise is completed.
